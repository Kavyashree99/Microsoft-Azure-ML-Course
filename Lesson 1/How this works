Welcome and Congratulations!
Udacity and Microsoft are excited to welcome you to the Introduction to Machine Learning on Azure . Here are some helpful details as you start the program.

How the Scholarship Foundation works:
The lessons in this course have been designed to introduce you to Machine Learning capabilities using Azure.
We recommend you take the time to go through the carefully prepared lessons, 
as well as the labs which are required for course completion to qualify for a Nanodegree scholarship.
If you have questions, we encourage you to ask directly in our student community.
